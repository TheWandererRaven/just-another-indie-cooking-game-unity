   - [ ] Off-hand Interact with objects
      - [ ] Player interaction trigger
         - Press E to interact
      - [ ] Object interaction handler
   - [ ] Redistribute player features & cleanup
   - [ ] Inventory & Inventory management
   - [ ] Pickup (store in inventory)
      - Press E to pick up (pick up obj / objectPickable bool)
   - [ ] Object drag & snap
      - With empty hand (or no interaction object) hold right click to enter snap mode.
2. Assamblement Station
